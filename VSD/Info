Notes:

Minior improvement:
Keep the GND trace all on the bottom. Move the Phase signal to top for consistancy

I don't know whether any problems will be caused by having a ground loop. Perhaps the trace shoud be broken towards the bottom Gate driver chip
I can't figure out the consequences of either choice.
